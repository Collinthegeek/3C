I don't want to write a script... Here's how to manually do it. Make a github issue if you have problems
Download python from python.org
Install python
Download and install pygame from pygame.org
I haven't tested this but you should now be able to double click on "main.py" to run it. If that doesn't work right click and look for something that looks python related.
