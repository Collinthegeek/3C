This game pretty much sucks and is completely un-optimized. It basically just exists because I challenged myself to make a 3d first person game using Pygame.

Install by running install.sh as root

map1 will always work, map0 is a testing map that might have placeholders and broken stuff. Any maps after map1 will be other functional levels.
